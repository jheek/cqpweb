This directory is for plugins.

Plugins can be used for very configurable tasks - like tagging text, or transliterating query results into a different
alphabet.

You will find some example plugins are already here - they are supplied alongside CQPweb.

The plugin system is explained in detail in the CQPweb System Administrator's manual.
