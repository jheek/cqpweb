## Steps to setup docker container

Starts and builds the container (if necessary)
```
docker-compose up -d --build cwb
```

Enter the docker machine with an interactive bash session
```
docker exec -it cqpweb_cwb_1 bash
```

This will setup the database and user
```
cat /tmp/cwb/mysql_setup | mysql
```

This will reset the databse (This removes all data!)
```
cat /tmp/cwb/mysql_clear | mysql
```

Create a directory for uploaded files
```
mkdir /cqp/upload
mkdir /corpora/data/
```

This will setup the database
```
cd /var/www/bin
php autosetup.php
```


Mappings to the host file system are given in `docker-compose.yml`.

A database dump can be created for backup and migration purposes:
```
mysqldump cqpweb > /cqp/dbdump.sql
```
This command should be executed within the container. The dump is stored in the shared folderr `cqp`.
